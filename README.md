### Summary
I am 23 years old master graduate in hospitality management. My career path is various and due to that I have obtained all the necessary skills to feel myself confident
and competent in an Technical Support role. However I would like to move even more forward and challenge myself in participating at [Hack Your Future](https://hackyourfuture.be/).

Hopefully soon I would be able not only provide great support to the customers, but also be a part of web development!
